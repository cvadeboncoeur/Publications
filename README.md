**Title of publication**: A meta-analysis of weight gain in first year university students: is freshman 15 a myth? BMC Obesity

**Background**: This meta-analysis aimed to update the literature on the “Freshman 15” in the first year of university. We also aimed to explore weight gain in only those who gained weight and perform several subgroup analyses. Given adolescent weight gain is highly linked to overweight and obesity in adults, a better understanding of university student weight gain is crucial if we are to combat the rising adult obesity prevalence.

**Methods**: We conducted a search on six standard electronic databases (including PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo) from 1980 to 2014. Only peer reviewed articles with data from longitudinal studies were included. Screening was performed by two reviewers. The quality of papers was assessed and data extraction was done with a systematic approach.


### Vadeboncoeur et al. 2017 BMC Obesity
**Title of publication**: Freshman 15 in England: a longitudinalevaluation of first year university student’sweight change

**Background:** Weight change in first year university students, often referred to as‘Freshman 15’, has been shown tobe a common problem in North America. Studies have reported weight gain to be between 1 kg and 4 kg overthe academic year and a recent meta-analysis found a mean gain of 1.34 kg and that 61 % of students gainedweight. A limited number of studies have investigated weight change in England and large scale studies areneeded to understand better weight change trends and to conduct subgroup analyses. This is important in thecontext of rising obesity prevalence, especially as behaviours and unhealthy weight in early adulthood oftenremains over the lifetime.

**Methods:** We recruited students across 23 universities in England to complete a web-based survey at three timepoints in 2014–2015: beginning of academic year, December, end of academic year. Students were asked toself-report height and weight. We calculated weight change of each student between time points and conductedt-tests and pared analysis of variance to investigate the effect of time, sex and initial BMI. We also investigatedweight change amongst weight gainers and in weight losers separately.

**Results:** We followed 215 students over three time points and found a mean weight change of 0.98 kg (95%CI 0.49–1.47) over a mean length of 34 weeks of follow-up. The weight change rate was not significantly different overdifferent terms. Over 51 % of the sample gained more than 0.5 kg by the end of the academic year, with a meangain of 3.46 kg. Female weight gainers had a significantly lower baseline weight than non-weight gaining females.Twenty-five percent of the sample lost more than 0.5 kg with a mean of−3.21 kg. Within weight losers, males lostsignificantly more weight than females.

**Conclusion:** Our findings reinforce that the first year of university is a crucial time in the life of students duringwhich the majority tend to gain weight. However, we also found that 25 % lost weight, indicating that 75 % ofstudents undergo a meaningful weight change in their first year. Universities must recognise their role inpromoting healthy weight maintenance
