### Vadeboncoeur et al. 2015 BMC Obesity
**Title of publication**: A meta-analysis of weight gain in first year university students: is freshman 15 a myth? BMC Obesity
**Background**: This meta-analysis aimed to update the literature on the “Freshman 15” in the first year of university. We also aimed to explore weight gain in only those who gained weight and perform several subgroup analyses. Given adolescent weight gain is highly linked to overweight and obesity in adults, a better understanding of university student weight gain is crucial if we are to combat the rising adult obesity prevalence.
**Methods**: We conducted a search on six standard electronic databases (including PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo) from 1980 to 2014. Only peer reviewed articles with data from longitudinal studies were included. Screening was performed by two reviewers. The quality of papers was assessed and data extraction was done with a systematic approach.
